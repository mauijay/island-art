create a migration for Artists, Events, galleries, exhibitions.
when an artist submits artwork:
i would like to swap out the json code you wrote in ApiController with a database entry.
i want the artists info to go to artist table, then create a user in users table and link the two with a foreign key.
then i want the uploaded images to go to the images table, the artwork info to go to the Artwork table and link the two with a foreign key.
make all necessary adjustments to this project to complete these tasks
