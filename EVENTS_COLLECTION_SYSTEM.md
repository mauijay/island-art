# ðŸŽ¨ Hawaii Art Events Collection System

This system automatically collects art events from various Hawaiian cultural institutions and updates the database weekly.

## How to Use

1. **Share your original Python script**: Please paste your original Python script in this file so I can understand:
   - What data sources you're using
   - What format the events are in
   - How the collection logic works

2. **I'll then create**:
   - Enhanced Python script for automated collection
   - CodeIgniter command for running the script
   - Cron job setup
   - Dynamic calendar page updates

## Original Python Script
Please paste your script here:

```python
# Paste your original Python script here
```

## Data Sources to Collect From
Based on your calendar page, these institutions should be included:
- Downtown Art Center (Honolulu)
- Volcano Art Center Gallery
- Hui NoÊ»eau Visual Arts Center (Maui)
- Maui Arts & Cultural Center
- Hawaii Craftsmen
- Other Hawaiian galleries and cultural centers

## Expected Event Data Format
```json
{
  "title": "Event Title",
  "description": "Event description", 
  "start_date": "2025-10-15",
  "end_date": "2025-11-01",
  "location": "Gallery Name",
  "address": "123 Main St, Honolulu, HI",
  "island": "Oahu",
  "event_type": "exhibition",
  "website_url": "https://example.com",
  "is_featured": false
}
```

Once you share your script, I'll create the complete automated system!
