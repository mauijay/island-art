please audit my total project and make suggestions as necessary to produce a modern and stylish website that exudes a confidant artistic flair that is consistent with hawaiian art culture.

I would like a home page to have a hero section, a recents news posts section and an art info section.

the contact us page seems very incomplete.

edit the galleries page to show an array of images with sample data i can work on later to complete myself.

edit the artist page to highlight one artist per month and then have a section to showcase three other local artists.

i will fix the submit art button later.
